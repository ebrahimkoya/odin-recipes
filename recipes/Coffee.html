    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>While Ebrahim is renowned for his chai, he also has started his coffee journey. Starting with a simple keurig brewer, he now prefers to hand grind his coffee beans and use an aeropress to brew his daily cup of coffee!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coffee Beans (Preferably medium roast)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>An Aeropress</li>
        <li>A kettle</li>
        <li>A scale</li>
        <li><b>Optionally:</b> Sugar, milk or creamer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Weigh out 16g of coffee (if using whole bean, grind it)</li>
        <li>Brew the kettle untill the water starts boiling</li>
        <li>Assemble the Aeropress onto the mug, placing the coffee grinds into it</li>
        <li>Pour in 200g of the nearly boiling water into the aeropress, ensuring that all coffee grinds are immersed</li>
        <li>Place the Aeropress plunger into the chamber, creating a vaccum that stops coffee from pouring into the mug</li>
        <li>Let the coffee grinds rest for two minutes or longer</li>
        <li>When ready, Push the plunger through the chamber, extracting your coffee into the mug</li>
        <li>Finish with creamer and sugar if you so choose</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
